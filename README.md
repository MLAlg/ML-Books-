Machine Learning Books

These are some of the most useful books for me during learning algorithms:

1. Machine Learning An Algorithmic Perspective by Stephen Marsland 

2. Kernel Methods and Machine Learning by S.Y.Kung

3. Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python by Ra√∫l Garreta and Guillermo Moncecchi
